# MountainCar-v0
This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the classic MountainCar-v0 environment from Gymnasium (Farama AI).

The MountainCar problem consists of driving a car out of a valley by building enough momentum to reach the goal at the top of a hill. Since the engine power is insufficient to go straight up, the agent must learn to move back and forth strategically to succeed.


## Project Overview

- Chromosome Representation: encodes the parameters of a simple decision policy (e.g., weights for a linear model or a small neural network).

- Fitness Function: total reward accumulated across multiple simulation episodes.

### Genetic Algorithm Components:

- Selection, crossover, and mutation operators.

- Population of at least 30 individuals.

- Minimum of 50 generations.

- Experimentation: runs with at least 3 different parameter configurations (population size, mutation rate, crossover type, etc.).

- Evaluation: plots of average and maximum fitness per generation.


## Deliverables

- Source code with modular structure and documentation.

- Experimental results and visualizations.

- Technical report analyzing the performance of different GA configurations.


## Execution

1. Install dependencies with Poetry  
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

2. Run a single GA experiment (baseline config)  
   ```bash
   poetry run python src/main.py
   ```  
   Generates:  
   - `src/experiments/logs.txt`  
   - `src/experiments/outputs/training_curve.png`

3. Run multiple GA configurations (baseline, high_mutation, large_population)  
   ```bash
   poetry run python src/experiments/results.py
   ```  
   Generates for each config:  
   - `fitness_<config>.png`  
   - `fitness_<config>.csv`  
   (saved under `src/experiments/outputs/`)

4. Compare results across configurations  
   ```bash
   poetry run python src/experiments/compare_results.py
   ```  
   Generates:  
   - `comparison.png`  
   (saved under `src/experiments/outputs/`)
